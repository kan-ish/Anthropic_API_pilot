### Iteration 1 - pilot
Same thing as task 1, although I am now using the `tools` top level parameter to define all my tools. This is better when defining multiple tools as Claude will be able to choose between tools better when I specify the `tool-choice` to `auto`/`any` parameter later. It is also more readable as my sytem prompt won't get cluttered.

### Iteration 2 - trying to make it work like a chatbot (back and forth convos)
Getting Claude to generate blogs for me and calling the save_to_db function worked on the first try, but it only sustains for one back and forth dialogue between the user and Claude. I am having trouble in keeping the conversation going until the user explicitly asks Claude to save it.

Input tokens have risen to 1179 - over the specified limit of 1024. Don't understand why it didn't cut off at 1024. Will have to read about it.

### Iteration 4
Managed to get some complete and extractable data in the `tool_input` parameter Claude's response. Claude had to ask me for author name and title of the article (which is desired behaviour), but how do I let the user know that Claude is expecting these inputs? One possible solution will be to use a prefilled response. Another is to tell Claude to use custom XML tags like `<expecting_input>`. The former will probably increase input_token count more than the latter one. Also, using custom XML tags seem easier to identify on client side.

Adding the `expecting_input` tags helped in intimating to the user what information Claude wants from the user.

As pollinators, they play a crucial role in the reproduction of many flowering plants, including crops we depend on for food. Bees collect nectar and pollen from flowers to feed themselves and their young. In the process, pollen sticks to their fuzzy bodies and gets transferred between flowers, enabling cross-pollination.\n\nThere are many different species of bees, from the well-known honeybees and bumblebees to less familiar species like mason bees and leafcutter bees. Honeybees are social insects that live in large colonies, with a complex caste system that includes the queen bee, worker bees, and drones. They produce honey from flower nectar, which serves as a food source for the colony during times when flowers are not blooming.\n\nSadly, many bee populations are in decline worldwide due to a combination of factors like habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change. This is concerning not just for the bees themselves, but for the countless plants and broader ecosystems that depend on them. Efforts are underway to better understand the causes of these declines and find ways to protect and support bees.\n\nWe can all help bees in small ways by planting pollinator-friendly flowers, avoiding pesticides, and supporting organizations working to conserve them.

### Iteration ~ 10 - Pay wall
Was wondering when this would show up.

Claude was unable to maintain context of previous messages in the conversations, even the message just before the current message. I guessed that I used up my quota of the current model and was demoted to an inferior model. Claude API usage tells me that I was using Sonnet for the last few tokens, which confirms my suspicion.
```
anthropic.BadRequestError: Error code: 400 - {'type': 'error', 'error': {'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'message': 'Your credit balance is too low to access the Claude API. Please go to Plans & Billing to upgrade or purchase credits.'}}
```

### Iteration ~ 20 - Saving working
Output is longer because I have added a few extra logs

Other times, it will forget what article the user is talking about just in the next message.
There have also been instances where Claude didn't follow the instructions given in the system prompt. For example, it will sometimes infer the value of the title of the blog, or make up a random name for the author. Sometimes it will say in the `<thinking>` tag that the user has not provided these details, so it will ask the user, and in the same response it will infer those same values it was going to ask the user. It will also sometimes think that the user wants to save the article when the user has only asked to "write" the article. All these clauses have been explicitly mentioned in the system prompt, but I am trying to tweek it to make Claude's behaviour more consistent. I finally switched to 3.5 Sonnet after multiple instances of context retention problems.

### sucessfully retrieve and save the article
This method generates a lot of tokens, but gets the job done. Will consider optimizing it once the core features are complete.

Bees: Nature's Tiny Striped Overachievers

Bees, nature's diligent pollinators and self-appointed fashion icons, play a crucial role in our ecosystem. These buzzing insects, with their distinctive black and yellow stripes (talk about committing to a look!), are the master architects of hexagonal honeycomb structures - because apparently, circles are too mainstream for these geometric geniuses.

Bees communicate through intricate dances, proving that they were into interpretive dance way before it was cool. They work tirelessly to collect nectar and pollen, making the rest of us feel lazy for complaining about our 9-to-5 jobs. And let's not forget their side gig as honey producers - because who doesn't love a sweet side hustle?

Their importance in agriculture and biodiversity cannot be overstated, which is why bee conservation efforts are vital for our planet's future. After all, without bees, who would keep our flowers entertained with their incessant buzzing small talk?

Remember, folks: Save the bees! They're the only insects cool enough to have their own emoji! 🐝
