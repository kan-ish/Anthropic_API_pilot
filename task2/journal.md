### Iteration 1 - pilot
Same thing as task 1, although I am now using the `tools` top level parameter to define all my tools. This is better when defining multiple tools as Claude will be able to choose between tools better when I specify the `tool-choice` to `auto`/`any` parameter later. It is also more readable as my sytem prompt won't get cluttered.

### Iteration 2 - trying to make it work like a chatbot (back and forth convos)
Getting Claude to generate blogs for me and calling the save_to_db function worked on the first try, but it only sustains for one back and forth dialogue between the user and Claude. I am having trouble in keeping the conversation going until the user explicitly asks Claude to save it.

Input tokens have risen to 1179 - over the specified limit of 1024. Don't understand why it didn't cut off at 1024. Will have to read about it.

### Iteration 4
Managed to get some complete and extractable data in the `tool_input` parameter Claude's response. Claude had to ask me for author name and title of the article (which is desired behaviour), but how do I let the user know that Claude is expecting these inputs? One possible solution will be to use a prefilled response. Another is to tell Claude to use custom XML tags like `<expecting_input>`. The former will probably increase input_token count more than the latter one. Also, using custom XML tags seem easier to identify on client side.

As pollinators, they play a crucial role in the reproduction of many flowering plants, including crops we depend on for food. Bees collect nectar and pollen from flowers to feed themselves and their young. In the process, pollen sticks to their fuzzy bodies and gets transferred between flowers, enabling cross-pollination.\n\nThere are many different species of bees, from the well-known honeybees and bumblebees to less familiar species like mason bees and leafcutter bees. Honeybees are social insects that live in large colonies, with a complex caste system that includes the queen bee, worker bees, and drones. They produce honey from flower nectar, which serves as a food source for the colony during times when flowers are not blooming.\n\nSadly, many bee populations are in decline worldwide due to a combination of factors like habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change. This is concerning not just for the bees themselves, but for the countless plants and broader ecosystems that depend on them. Efforts are underway to better understand the causes of these declines and find ways to protect and support bees.\n\nWe can all help bees in small ways by planting pollinator-friendly flowers, avoiding pesticides, and supporting organizations working to conserve them.

### Iteration ~ 10 - Pay wall
Was wondering when this would show up.

Claude was unable to maintain context of previous messages in the conversations, even the message just before the current message. I guessed that I used up my quota of the current model and was demoted to an inferior model. Claude API usage tells me that I was using Sonnet for the last few tokens, which confirms my suspicion.
```
anthropic.BadRequestError: Error code: 400 - {'type': 'error', 'error': {'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'message': 'Your credit balance is too low to access the Claude API. Please go to Plans & Billing to upgrade or purchase credits.'}}

### Iteration ~ 20 - Saving working
Output is longer because I have added a few extra logs

Problems I am facing now - 
* Claude inferring values instead of asking the user, despite mentioning explicitly in the system prompt not to do so. I suspect this can be fixed by using a different model. But what is confusing me is that this just started suddenly, without any changes to the system prompt.
* Claude can't remember the context of the previous message(s).
* Claude omitting required fields in `tool_input` parameter in response.
* Claude's behaviour not consistent. It will think it will ask the user for input but then doesn't and infers the values instead.
* Claude thinking user has given an instruction when the user hasn't (attempting to save when the user just asked it to generate).

I have now tweeked the system prompt and the tool descriptions and also switched to 3.5 Sonnet. The behaviour now seems to have improved.

### sucessfully retrieve and save the article
This method generates a lot of tokens, but gets the job done. Will consider optimizing it once the core features are complete.

Original Version:
<article>
Bees, nature's diligent pollinators, play a crucial role in our ecosystem. These buzzing insects, with their distinctive black and yellow stripes, are master architects of hexagonal honeycomb structures.

Proposed Funny Version:

Bees: Nature's Tiny Striped Overachievers

Bees, nature's diligent pollinators and self-appointed fashion icons, play a crucial role in our ecosystem. These buzzing insects, with their distinctive black and yellow stripes (talk about committing to a look!), are the master architects of hexagonal honeycomb structures - because apparently, circles are too mainstream for these geometric geniuses.

Bees communicate through intricate dances, proving that they were into interpretive dance way before it was cool. They work tirelessly to collect nectar and pollen, making the rest of us feel lazy for complaining about our 9-to-5 jobs. And let's not forget their side gig as honey producers - because who doesn't love a sweet side hustle?

Their importance in agriculture and biodiversity cannot be overstated, which is why bee conservation efforts are vital for our planet's future. After all, without bees, who would keep our flowers entertained with their incessant buzzing small talk?

Remember, folks: Save the bees! They're the only insects cool enough to have their own emoji! 🐝

I'll provide you with a rewritten version of the article about bees, focusing on a more serious tone while maintaining the important information. Here's the revised version:\n\n<article>\nBees: Critical Components of Earth's Ecosystem\n\nBees are essential insects that play a vital role in our planet's ecological balance. As primary pollinators, they are crucial for the reproduction of many plant species, including numerous crops that humans rely on for food.\n\nThese small, striped insects are known for their complex social structures and remarkable efficiency. Bees live in colonies, often consisting of thousands of individuals, each with specific roles. The most well-known species, the honey bee, is particularly noteworthy for its ability to produce honey and beeswax.\n\nBees possess several unique characteristics that make them exceptionally effective pollinators:\n\n1. Specialized body structures: Their bodies are covered in fine hairs that easily pick up pollen as they move from flower to flower.\n\n2. Communication skills: Bees use intricate dances to communicate the location of food sources to other members of their colony.\n\n3. Navigational abilities: They can fly several miles from their hive and accurately find their way back.\n\n4. Systematic foraging: Bees typically focus on one type of flower at a time, ensuring efficient cross-pollination.\n\nThe importance of bees extends far beyond honey production. They are critical to maintaining biodiversity and supporting agricultural systems worldwide. It's estimated that bees are responsible for pollinating approximately 75% of global crops, making them indispensable to food security.\n\nHowever, bee populations face numerous threats, including habitat loss, pesticide use, climate change, and disease. The decline in bee populations observed in recent years is a cause for serious concern among scientists and environmentalists.\n\nConservation efforts are crucial to protect these invaluable insects. These include:\n\n1. Reducing pesticide use, particularly neonicotinoids which are harmful to bees.\n2. Creating and preserving bee-friendly habitats.\n3. Supporting sustainable beekeeping practices.\n4. Promoting public awareness about the importance of bees.\n\nIn conclusion, bees are far more than simple insects. They are keystone species in many ecosystems and play a critical role in global food production.

Bees: Critical Components of Earth's Ecosystem

Bees are essential insects that play a vital role in our planet's ecological balance. As primary pollinators, they are crucial for the reproduction of many plant species, including numerous crops that humans rely on for food.

These small, striped insects are known for their complex social structures and remarkable efficiency. Bees live in colonies, often consisting of thousands of individuals, each with specific roles. The most well-known species, the honey bee, is particularly noteworthy for its ability to produce honey and beeswax.

Bees possess several unique characteristics that make them exceptionally effective pollinators:

1. Specialized body structures: Their bodies are covered in fine hairs that easily pick up pollen as they move from flower to flower.

2. Communication skills: Bees use intricate dances to communicate the location of food sources to other members of their colony.

3. Navigational abilities: They can fly several miles from their hive and accurately find their way back.

4. Systematic foraging: Bees typically focus on one type of flower at a time, ensuring efficient cross-pollination.

The importance of bees extends far beyond honey production. They are critical to maintaining biodiversity and supporting agricultural systems worldwide. It's estimated that bees are responsible for pollinating approximately 75% of global crops, making them indispensable to food security.

However, bee populations face numerous threats, including habitat loss, pesticide use, climate change, and disease. The decline in bee populations observed in recent years is a cause for serious concern among scientists and environmentalists.

Conservation efforts are crucial to protect these invaluable insects. These include:

1. Reducing pesticide use, particularly neonicotinoids which are harmful to bees.
2. Creating and preserving bee-friendly habitats.
3. Supporting sustainable beekeeping practices.
4. Promoting public awareness about the importance of bees.

In conclusion, bees are far more than simple insects. They are keystone species in many ecosystems and play a critical role in global food production. Protecting bee populations is not just about preserving a single species, but about maintaining the delicate balance of our entire ecosystem.
